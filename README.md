# Lets Argue(NBA) :basketball:
A.K.A 'Numbers Never Lie'. Compare NBA players' stats throughout seasons, argue with friends about it!

*This is a project I made during the 'bubble-season' of the NBA. I wanted to mainly practice my class component React skills, as well as make something useful for bettors, or people who just like to have a quick stats lookup.*


## Deployed at:
